### Azure DevOps Governance Generator

Now that you have the knowledge about the importance of adopting Governance and what tools Azure makes available for you to implement, how about starting to put it into practice?

Having a board containing all the information related to governance from the details of how it works to the details on how to implement it could be useful?  Also, if you could share this board with your entire team to discuss each point, delegate activities, create iterations and track the progress of each task, would it be interesting?

### Azure Governance Visualizer

What do you think about having a graphical representation on your Governance implementation?  Let me present you one of my favorite tools: [AzGovViz](https://github.com/JulianHayward/Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting).

The AzGovViz (Azure governance visualizer) is a PowerShell script that iterates through an Azure tenant's management group hierarchy down to the subscription level. It captures data from the most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and Azure Blueprints. From the collected data, the visualizer shows your hierarchy map, creates a tenant summary, and builds granular scope insights about your management groups and subscriptions.
